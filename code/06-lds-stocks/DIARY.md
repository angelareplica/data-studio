To remain in good standing with the LDS church, Mormons are expected to tithe 10% of their salaries. Where does that money go? The LDS church is also notoriously secretive about their finances, but they recently revealed that they invest a portion of their money in the stock market.
Mormonleaks, a whistleblowing non-profit, compiled data from SEC filings made by 13 LLCs that they believe are linked to the LDS church. (They've promised me more detailed information on how they've arrived at their conclusions.) I'd like to look at what kinds of companies the LDS church is investing in.
