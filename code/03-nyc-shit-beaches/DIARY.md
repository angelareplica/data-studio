Which Shit-Spattered NYC Beach Should You Swim at This Summer?

I'm interested in looking at the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene's data on water quality at NYC beaches -- specifically the fecal bacteria counts in samples.

Steps:
-Look at all the beaches surveyed for a better idea of how expansive the data is
-Plot bar chart of samples that exceed the NYC Health Code (104 CFU/mL) from 2018
-Plot a scatterplot showing the bacteria counts taken at two of the most popular public NYC beache areas Coney Island and the Rockaways
-Plot heatmaps showing the average bacteria count per sample by year, as well as 2018 by month
7/31/2018
-Realize that the DOH&MH has released new data that includes July 
-Re-do everything with the updated data
-Fix up and annotate charts in Illutrator
