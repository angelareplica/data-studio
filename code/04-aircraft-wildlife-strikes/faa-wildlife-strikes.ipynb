       "      <td>ID BY SMITHSONIAN, FAA 3015.  DNA MATCH. A/C CRASHED IN A MARSH NEAR MORGAN CITY, LA. NTSB INVESTIGATED.  BOTH PILOTS AND SIX OF SEVEN PASSENGERS ON BOARD WERE KILLED. ONE PERSON WAS CRITICALY INJURED. A/C DEPTD LAKE PALOURDE BASE HELIPORT IN AMELIA, LA EN ROUTE TO SOUTH TIMBALIER OIL PLATFORM. DEPTR AS 1402. SATELLITE TRACKING SUDDENLY ENDED ABOUT 7 MINS LATER AT 1409. SEARCH AND RESCUE WAS INITIATED AT 1414 AFTER USAF NOTIFIED PHI AND USCG OF A DISTRESS SIGNAL. WRECKAGE WAS FOUND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, PARTIALLY SUBMERGED AND EXHIBITED VERY LITTLE MAIN ROTOR BLADE DMG.  APHIS WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS ASSISTED THE NTSB TEAM IN COLLECTING BIOLOGICAL DNA AND FEATHER SAMPLES FROM THE WINDSHIELD WHICH WAS SENT TO THE SMITHSONIAN FEATHER ID LAB. THE WINDSHLD HAS SEVERAL RING-SHAPED FRACTURES. ANALYSIS OF THE SOUNDS ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER REVEAL A SUDDEN LOUD BANG FOLLOWED BY AN INTENSE RUSH OF WIND. THE BOARD SAID ONE SECOND LATER, POWER FROM BOTH OF THE ENGINES SIMULTANEOUSLY DROPPED TO ALMOST NOTHING. PROBABLY CAUSE WAS SUDDEN LOST OFF POWER TO BOTH ENGS WHICH RESULTED FROM IMPACT WITH BIRD WHICH FRACTURED THE WINDSHLD AND INTERFERRED WITH ENG FUEL CONTROLS AND SUBSEQUENT DISORIENTATION OF FLT CREW WHICH LEFT THEM UNABLE TO RECOVER FROM THE LOSS OF POWER. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS ACCIDENT WERE (1) LACK OF FAA REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE AT THE TIME THE A/C WAS CERTIFICATED, REQUIRING WINDSHLDS TO BE RESISTANT TO BIRDSTRIKES: (2) LACK OF PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE T-HANDLES FROM INADVERTENTLY DISLODGING OUT OF THEIR DETENTS: AND (3) LACK OF MASTER WARNING LIGHT AND AUDIBLE SYSTEM TO ALERT THE FLT CREW OF A LOW-ROTOR-SPEED CONDITION.

APHIS WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS ASSISTED THE NTSB TEAM IN COLLECTING BIOLOGICAL DNA AND FEATHER SAMPLES FROM THE WINDSHIELD WHICH WAS SENT TO THE SMITHSONIAN FEATHER ID LAB. THE WINDSHLD HAS SEVERAL RING-SHAPED FRACTURES. ANALYSIS OF THE SOUNDS ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER REVEAL A SUDDEN LOUD BANG FOLLOWED BY AN INTENSE RUSH OF WIND. THE BOARD SAID ONE SECOND LATER, POWER FROM BOTH OF THE ENGINES SIMULTANEOUSLY DROPPED TO ALMOST NOTHING. PROBABLY CAUSE WAS SUDDEN LOST OFF POWER TO BOTH ENGS WHICH RESULTED FROM IMPACT WITH BIRD WHICH FRACTURED THE WINDSHLD AND INTERFERRED WITH ENG FUEL CONTROLS AND SUBSEQUENT DISORIENTATION OF FLT CREW WHICH LEFT THEM UNABLE TO RECOVER FROM THE LOSS OF POWER. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS ACCIDENT WERE (1) LACK OF FAA REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE AT THE TIME THE A/C WAS CERTIFICATED, REQUIRING WINDSHLDS TO BE RESISTANT TO BIRDSTRIKES: (2) LACK OF PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE T-HANDLES FROM INADVERTENTLY DISLODGING OUT OF THEIR DETENTS: AND (3) LACK OF MASTER WARNING LIGHT AND AUDIBLE SYSTEM TO ALERT THE FLT CREW OF A LOW-ROTOR-SPEED CONDITION.

       "      <td>While cruising at 5,500 above msl near Bathurst, NSW, the a/c colidded with a large bird, believed to be a wede-tailed eagle. The bird broke through the windscreen on the lt side of the a/c and struck the pilot. The ocllision left the pilot with serious facial injuries and they were temporarily unable to see. The pilot was wearing a headset and spectacles, which were both dislodged and damaged during the collision. Foloowing the collision, the a/c entered a rapid descent, but the pilot recovered sufficiently to regain control. Despite the broken windscreen and their injuries the pilot was able to divert to Bathurst Airport and landed successfully. During the ordeal, the pilot located the microphone of the headset and transmited a mayday call, but damage to the headset meant that they were unable to hear any incoming transmissions. ATC received the mayday call but did not know the callsign or specific location of the a/c involved or the intentions of the pilot. About 30 minutes after the mayday call, the Safety Officer at Bathurst Airport contacted ATC to advise them that an a/c with a broken windscreen (the result of a birdstrike) had landed at Bathurst.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The aircraft was crossing through the KRSW Class C airspace when they struck a large bird at 1000' approximately three miles west of KRSW. The aircraft's windshield was completely damaged and the pilots decided to land the aircraft on Runway 06 as it was the nearest runway. The two pilots on board were not injured due to the strike. Airport Operations inspected the runway and found no remains. Snarge was collected and sent to the Smithsonian for identification. PER EMAIL FROM PILOT, BOTH PILOT AND PAX HAD BRUISES (PILOT BRUISED SHOULDER AND PAX BRUISED FOREHEAD. BOTH THE RESULT OF THE WINDSHIELD BREAKING IN ON THEM WHEN THE BIRD HIT THE WINDSHIELD. KNOCKED OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE WINDSCREEN. SUBSTANTIAL DMG PER AS40 GUIDANCE DOCUMENT. LANDED SAFELY AT KRSW. MOR Remarks: CGX4793 CALLED WEST VFR FOR FLIGHT FOLLOWING TO FL59 ABOUT 12 SOUTHWEST OF RSW. SHORTLY THEREAFTER CGX4793 STARTED SQUAWKING EMERGENCY AND TOLD WEST THAT THEY HAD HIT A BIRD. WEST TOLD THEM RWY 6 AT RSW WAS AVAILABLE SO THEY PROCEEDED INBOUND TO RSW. THEN THEY LOST COMMUNICATIONS. OUR TOWER GAVE THEM A GREEN LIGHT GUN TO LAND. CGX4793 EVENTUALLY CAME BACK TO WEST WHO CLEARED THEM TO LAND. OUR TOWER CALLED AN ALERT #2 TO THE FIRE STATION. CGX4793 LANDED AND TURNED OFF THE RUNWAY WITHOUT INCIDENT THOUGH THEIR WINDSHIELD WAS BLOWN OUT FROM THE BIRD STRIKE.</td>\n",

       "73032   While cruising at 5,500 above msl near Bathurst, NSW, the a/c colidded with a large bird, believed to be a wede-tailed eagle. The bird broke through the windscreen on the lt side of the a/c and struck the pilot. The ocllision left the pilot with serious facial injuries and they were temporarily unable to see. The pilot was wearing a headset and spectacles, which were both dislodged and damaged during the collision. Foloowing the collision, the a/c entered a rapid descent, but the pilot recovered sufficiently to regain control. Despite the broken windscreen and their injuries the pilot was able to divert to Bathurst Airport and landed successfully. During the ordeal, the pilot located the microphone of the headset and transmited a mayday call, but damage to the headset meant that they were unable to hear any incoming transmissions. ATC received the mayday call but did not know the callsign or specific location of the a/c involved or the intentions of the pilot. About 30 minutes after the mayday call, the Safety Officer at Bathurst Airport contacted ATC to advise them that an a/c with a broken windscreen (the result of a birdstrike) had landed at Bathurst.                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "87645   The aircraft was crossing through the KRSW Class C airspace when they struck a large bird at 1000' approximately three miles west of KRSW. The aircraft's windshield was completely damaged and the pilots decided to land the aircraft on Runway 06 as it was the nearest runway. The two pilots on board were not injured due to the strike. Airport Operations inspected the runway and found no remains. Snarge was collected and sent to the Smithsonian for identification. PER EMAIL FROM PILOT, BOTH PILOT AND PAX HAD BRUISES (PILOT BRUISED SHOULDER AND PAX BRUISED FOREHEAD. BOTH THE RESULT OF THE WINDSHIELD BREAKING IN ON THEM WHEN THE BIRD HIT THE WINDSHIELD. KNOCKED OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE WINDSCREEN. SUBSTANTIAL DMG PER AS40 GUIDANCE DOCUMENT. LANDED SAFELY AT KRSW. MOR Remarks: CGX4793 CALLED WEST VFR FOR FLIGHT FOLLOWING TO FL59 ABOUT 12 SOUTHWEST OF RSW. SHORTLY THEREAFTER CGX4793 STARTED SQUAWKING EMERGENCY AND TOLD WEST THAT THEY HAD HIT A BIRD. WEST TOLD THEM RWY 6 AT RSW WAS AVAILABLE SO THEY PROCEEDED INBOUND TO RSW. THEN THEY LOST COMMUNICATIONS. OUR TOWER GAVE THEM A GREEN LIGHT GUN TO LAND. CGX4793 EVENTUALLY CAME BACK TO WEST WHO CLEARED THEM TO LAND. OUR TOWER CALLED AN ALERT #2 TO THE FIRE STATION. CGX4793 LANDED AND TURNED OFF THE RUNWAY WITHOUT INCIDENT THOUGH THEIR WINDSHIELD WAS BLOWN OUT FROM THE BIRD STRIKE.   \n",
